How to use the character builder

Page one: Choose your Class
Each class will have pre-set stats and available skills. Every class has a different set of skills. You can choose one now and come back later to choose a different one if you want.
You may enter a name for your character, but if you choose not to, your character will be called "No Name."

Page two: Choose your stats
The stats are pre-set according to class, but you can customize them as you want. However, all three stats must add up to 100, or the program will not allow you to move onto the next page. No stat can be set at 0.
The program will calculate your current total and display it with the "Get Total" button. To set the stats back to default for your class, click "Reset."

Page three: Choose your skills
The available skills are based on the class you chose on page one. If you are unhappy with the available skills, you can click the arrow in the top left corner to go back to the previous page, and again on that page to return to the class selection.
Choose three skills by clicking the checkboxes next to the ones you want. You will not be able to move to the next page until you have chosen exactly three skills.

Page four: Your character
This page displays all details you have chosen for your character. You can screenshot this page or click the arrow at the top left to go back to the previous pages and make desired changes.
